#SQL Retail Sales Analysis (Project P1)


##Executive Summary

Retail transaction data was analyzed using SQL to answer key business questions around sales performance, customer behavior, product categories, and order timing.
The project focuses on data cleaning, aggregation, and analytical querying to generate actionable retail insights from raw transactional data.
The output queries help stakeholders understand:

1. Which categories drive the most revenue

2. Who the top customers are

3. When orders are most frequent

4. Which months perform best each year




##Business Questions Solved

Using SQL queries, the analysis answers key business questions including sales on specific dates, category performance and total revenue, identification of high-value transactions, customer demographics by category, top five customers by total spend, unique customers per category, transaction distribution by gender and category, best-selling month per year using window functions, and order distribution across time-of-day shifts.




##Methodology

1. Created database and retail_sales table

2. Cleaned data by removing NULL records in critical fields

3. Performed exploratory checks (counts, distinct categories, customers)


   

##Key SQL Skills Demonstrated:

Aggregations, Date & time functions, Window functions, CTEs, 




##Results & Insights Enabled:

The query set enables teams to quickly measure revenue by product category, identify customer concentration among top buyers, evaluate seasonal best-performing months, analyze the gender–category transaction mix, and understand order patterns by time-of-day shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening), thereby supporting faster reporting and reducing repeated ad-hoc analysis work.

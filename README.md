SQL Retail Sales Analysis (Project P1)


Executive Summary

Retail transaction data was analyzed using SQL to answer key business questions around sales performance, customer behavior, product categories, and order timing.
The project focuses on data cleaning, aggregation, and analytical querying to generate actionable retail insights from raw transactional data.
The output queries help stakeholders understand:

1. Which categories drive the most revenue

2. Who the top customers are

3. When orders are most frequent

4. Which months perform best each year



Business Questions Solved

1. Using SQL queries, the analysis answers:

2. Sales on specific dates

3. Category performance & total revenue

4. High-value transactions

5. Customer demographics by category

6. Top 5 customers by total spend

7. Unique customers per category

8. Transactions by gender & category

9. Best selling month per year (window functions)

10. Order distribution by time-of-day shifts



Methodology

1. Created database and retail_sales table

2. Cleaned data by removing NULL records in critical fields

3. Performed exploratory checks (counts, distinct categories, customers)



Wrote analytical SQL queries using:

1. Aggregations

2. Date & time functions

3. Window functions

4. CTEs

5. CASE logic for shift bucketing

   

Key SQL Skills Demonstrated:

GROUP BY & aggregates, DISTINCT & customer segmentation, Window functions, Date functions, CTE, Business-oriented query design





Results & Insights Enabled:

1. The query set enables teams to quickly measure:

2. Revenue by product category

3. Customer concentration among top buyers

4. Seasonal best-performing months

5. Gender-category transaction mix

6. Order patterns by shift (Morning / Afternoon / Evening)

This supports faster reporting and reduces repeated ad-hoc analysis work.
